                    <p>PlanGrid is a construction blueprints and project management software.</p> <p>It was acquired recently by Autodesk and is now under the Autodesk Construction Cloud.</p>
                </div>
                <section class="entry-desc">
                    <p>I spent two 4-month internships at PlanGrid. The first was as a frontend engineer, and the last as a backend engineer. Both internships were spent with the Photos team, 
                        which is responsible for serving photo-related features including a photo gallery and photos API.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Backend Internship</h1>
                    <p class="date">Sep. 2020 - Dec. 2020</p>
                    <p>Here, I worked primarily on the Photos backend service (Python) and Postgres databases. I dabbled in some cross-team work which involved Node JS backends and
                        tried my hand at the Kotlin service that powers PlanGrid's mobile client platforms.
                    </p>
                    <p>I built a self-synchronization (red badging) solution to provide a cohesive photos experience across platforms and clients. This involved efficiently computing
                        sync state during CUD operations and then flagging out-of-date clients. Before, clients would have to poll a sync state endpoint to see if they were up to date. With this change,
                        a decreased reliance on manual state polling was enabled.
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, I wrote solutions for visibility rules and role-based permissions for Photos.
                        Whereas photos were initially visible to everyone on a project, they are now shown only to users with the relevant role and permissions.</p>
                    <p>In this role, I also performed backfills and data migrations, as well as practiced test-driven development.</p>

                    <h1>Frontend Internship</h1>
                    <p class="date">Jan. 2020 - Apr. 2020</p>
                    <p>During this time, I worked mainly with React and Apollo Server, and added features like 360-photo viewing and cloud upload support PlanGrid's web photo gallery.</p>
                    <p>One of my main projects was to make photo reporting a better experience by adding support for customization and filtering. The reports were templated with React, and report
                         processing took place in a Python service. </p>
                         
                    <p>I also resolved a leading customer request by adding blueprint-based photo reporting to the Sheets feature of PlanGrid.
                         This allowed project users to print out an informative report of the photos attached to their construction sheets.
